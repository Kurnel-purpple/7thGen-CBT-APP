# Client Assets

This directory contains client-specific assets (logos, favicons).

## Note
Client asset folders are gitignored for privacy.
Each deployment should include the appropriate client assets.

## Structure
```
clients/
├── client-name/
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── favicon.png
```

See README.md for asset guidelines.
